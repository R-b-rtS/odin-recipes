        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 ounces dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>¾ (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Pour egg into a small shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into egg, then into bread crumbs. Place coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet.</li>

            <li>Pour 1/2 of the spaghetti sauce into a 7x11-inch baking dish. Place chicken breasts over the sauce, then cover with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>
