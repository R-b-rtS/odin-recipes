# odin-recipes

This is a simple recipe website built as part of my learning journey through The Odin Project.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to reinforce and apply the HTML concepts I’ve learned so far. I’m manually writing all the code — including the HTML boilerplate — to strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals.

Learning Approach
Every change is committed clearly and intentionally to reflect my progress.

I’ve included comments and notes throughout the codebase on:

Areas I struggled with
Concepts I had to revisit and relearn

Outcome
By the end of this project, I will have put into practice everything I’ve learned about basic HTML structure, elements, and file organisation.
